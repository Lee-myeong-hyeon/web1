<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target ="_blank">HTML</a> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br>HTML is the standard markup language for creating
Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements.
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into m
ultimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
cues for the appearance of the document.

<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
documents by denoting structural
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  directly introduce content into the page.
Other tags such as  surround and</p><p style="margin-top:40px;"><img src="beach.jpg" width=100%>
provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display
the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</body>
